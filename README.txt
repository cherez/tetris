This program, given a tetris board, determines whether it's possible for the
computer to force the player to lose without clearing a single line.

A terrible person could put this into a tetris game to make players miserable.

It's rather slow, because the branching factor is massive. It's probably a good
idea to move this to a static language. Alternately, smarter heuristics could
curb the branching factor.
